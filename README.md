# SoundSeq
## Introduction
SoundSeq is a prototype for an AI-powered SFX Sequencer that can automatically apply relevant sound effects at the right places given a video. It won Most Impressive Technical Feat in Pear x OpenAI's Hackathon!

## Use Cases
We see this being useful for batch automation of content creation (i.e reels or shorts), independent film creators (where SFX can take an upwards of 3 hours to find and place sounds), and dynamic SFX generation in games.
